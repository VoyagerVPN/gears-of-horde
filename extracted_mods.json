The Wasteland has become completely uninhabitable due to persistent, deadly radiation levels, requiring specialized protective gear to survive. However, venturing into this hostile zone is worth the risk, as it’s the only place to find titanium—a rare and incredibly durable metal that has surfaced there for unknown reasons.\nTo help you survive, BTO introduces a massive arsenal of weapons, crafted by the mod’s creator, RaDee, using models from open sources, as well as contributions from the renowned weapon pack creator Izayo. But that’s just the beginning. At the start of the game, you can choose your character’s backstory—soldier, farmer, wanderer, or more—each shaping your journey and skills, letting you decide who you’ll become in this post-apocalyptic world.\nBecome a legend with the mod’s legendary skill system, master crafting with an expanded crafting system, take to the skies by repairing a helicopter, or live a quieter life by the sea with an overhauled gardening and animal husbandry system.\nThis and much more awaits you in BTO.",

Several things you are used to being able to make now require classes or perks to be purchased, and night-time is not fun time. The wasteland? Even less so.\nThis is a mod I originally created to fix a few \"issues\" myself, my wife and some friends felt the game had. Turns out I really enjoy modding so I've expanded on it quite a bit. The intent is to drag out the early game, so it will take you longer than usual to get to Iron and Steel. As I started playing in Alpha 8,  I wanted to try and bring back a few things from that era. Sharp rocks and sticks are pretty good examples of that, and I want to try and incorporate more features from that era of gameplay.\nThe behemoth, originally unveiled in A16 and then scrapped is alive and well in this mod, along with some extra friends. Expect to see new zombies, new horrors and don't anticipate an easy ride. A mostly comprehensive list of features can be found below.",

    "description": "Forsaken Trail is a complete overhaul of the game and is the successor of Gnamod. The mod focuses on wilderness survival, exploration and improving the overal survival experience. This mod changes most of the game systems in an attempt to create something unique and it does not try to hold the player’s hand that much, making it quite challenging for anyone new to it. The world mostly decides the gamestage so going into higher level POIs or biomes may not be the wisest strategy because of this. You can find any item from the first day due to the unique way loot is generated where player level and gamestage only influence the amount you find.\nThe mod also comes with a unique character creation system where you select your attributes, skills and background before you spawn into the game. You will begin the game with gear and technology unlocked based on these choices. This gear in addition to a number of tutorial challenges will help you survive your first day and first week.\nThe zombies and animals in the world are all randomized, their walk, abilities and sizes will be decided the moment they spawn and are further influence by their type. You will encounter zombies that can puke or walk on all four legs. In the more natural biomes animals are more prevalent, while near cities and destroyed areas you will see a lot more zombies. Be careful around buildings as zombies will be awake and roaming around and they have keen ears.",

The gameplay, which is not related to the visual, will also undergo changes: there are plans to create new traps, including distracting ones; rebalancing weapons; creating new types (subspecies) of quests and creating quests of higher complexity than tier 5 or even 6; recoverable transport in the world; partial complexity of crafting and much more.\nAn additional idea of the mod is to make it only through xml, without additional programming and getting into the game code. There are two main reasons for this: I'm a bad coder; I don't want the mod to need special guides on how to install it, it should be enough to throw it into a folder – and that's it.\nSome plans and ideas have already been tested, have prototypes, some are only in the \"in theory it should work\" stage.

    "description": "Preppocalypse is an expansion for 7 Days to Die, from the perspective of a Prepper. In the context of 7 Days to Die, a Prepper is a survivor who prepared in advance for adverse situations and made it through the initial ‘event’ stage and aftermath. Preppocalypse places the player in the subsequent afterwards.\nDue to vigilance from before the initial ‘event’, a Prepper already has some features in place. These include increased inventory capacity, enhanced skill potential and choice, and access to other benefits considered helpful for survival. Preppocalypse recognizes a Prepper has an increased chance to thrive. As a tradeoff, in addition to the grunt, feral, and radiated hostile classes, there are ‘others’ out there to provide a more challenging and hostile environment. They will mostly be seen as game stage progresses, but be prepared for some surprises during Horde Night or in the biomes. This expansion builds on the post-apocalyptic theme of 7 Days to Die through an additive approach. As such, the majority of features will be very familiar. Additions are intuitive, enhancing, immersive, in context, supportive, and appropriately more threatening. While there will be periods of extremes, considered choices can restore balance.",

Ravenhearst is a full overhaul mod that uses the amazing 7 Days to Die and turns expectations in its head. Every aspect of the vanilla game has been tweaked or tuned to increase challenge and difficulty. Ravenhearst has often been called the mod that is not for everyone.

Below you will learn just a little bit about what we have to offer. Keep in mind that Ravenhearst, just like the actual 7 Days to Die game, is nowhere a near finished experience and it's development is ongoing, and as such should be played with the open mind that there can be major updates that will cause save breaks and resets to your game. We pride ourselves on using our team of testers to thoroughly play and beg test so that we can provide you with the most solid gaming experience we can manage to put forth. But also keep in mind as with anything, things can happen.",

    "description": "What Scavengers is is a tribute to traditional and classic zombie horror survival. If Ravenhearst is the Resident Evil of mods then Scavengers will be the Night of the Living Dead. Its focus is not on horde nights, or Demolishers, or even mutations but will be on primitive survival tactics, hordes of unrelenting WALKERS and respectful of established \"traditional\" zombie lore (no runners, headshots kill etc).\nThe challenge of this mod for me as we go forward is to make it as difficult as possible yet be something completely unexpected and different than what you would expect from 7 Days. We have Ravenhearst for the kitchen sink type of mod, this will be sleeker, meaner and rely more on natural challenges than things like bullet sponges. Building will not be the focus here, rather will be a luxury. Nomadic gameplay style and smart survival decisions will be key to your survival. Zombies will be enhanced with several new \"sniffing out\" techniques that could very quickly spell trouble for you in short order if you get overwhelmed. The gameplay will feel very similar in style to older Alphas, with less focus on points and perks and way more focus on crafting, resource gathering and scavenging of course.",

Some of His Original Modlets that were used to create this AIO are as follows. Around 20 or so more have been added directly to the AIO that cant be made into Modlets due to them needing certain bits of code from the AIO so would cause Conflicts",

This overhaul has a complete array of custom trees, Plants And its own models all paid for by myself so that the mod is as nice looking as possible.. You have a full selection of Seeds, Fruits, Berries and so on so you can make lots of different types of foods to compliment the main game.You can craft and build an entire farm along with custom animals, Benches and so on.
