## About this mod

The idea behind this mod is to slow progression, make traders less powerful, and generally extend the time for a playthrough, while keeping the vanilla look and feel.

## Features

## GENERAL GAMEPLAY

- Player starts with a new debuff – Despair.
    - **As your despair increases, your abilities will be negatively affected. If despair reaches 100%, you’ll be seconds from death.**
    - **Conversely, if you can manage your despair well, you’ll receive buffs for remaining positive.**
    - **The despair indicator on the HUD will fill as your despair grows and will change colour to indicate the level of your despair.**
    - **If you’re able to manage your despair and have a more positive outlook, the icon on the HUD will change, as will the fill colour to indicate your levels of positivity.**
    - **Despair can also be checked from the player information screen.**
- Despair is dynamically affected by various different factors, including:
    - 1: Darkness. Too dark, and your Despair will increase dramatically. Torches, helmet lights and flashlights will mitigate this. Use these in conjunction with a campfire for the best effect.
    - 2: Temperature. If you’re freezing or sweltering, your Despair will also increase dramatically. Find shelter!
    - 3: Environment: Varying degrees of “wetness” will change how Despair affects you, as will your shelter. If you’re warm, dry, sheltered, well lit or resting on a bed or bedroll, AND near an operating campfire, forge or chem station you can effectively “treat” Despair.
    - 4: Hunger and thirst affect how quickly your despair increases. Starvation/dehydration will drastically increase the rate at which you become affected by despair.
    - 5: Injuries will affect how quickly your despair increases.
    - 6: There is medication in trader stock and rare medical loot to treat your despair.
    - 6a: There is also lavender growing wild, which can be collected to make your own lavender seeds, and is also used to make Lavender Oil in a cooking pot at a campfire. Treats 3% Despair.
    - 7: All food has a positive effect. The better the food, the more effective the treatment.
    - 8: Killing zombies and animals will reduce your overall despair. Conversely, getting hit by enemies will increase it.
    - 9: Being in close proximity to zombies increases your Despair. The tougher the zombie, the worse the effect. The effect is compounded, so the more zombies there are, the worse it’ll be.
    - 10: Player “wellness”. Your maximum health will also slow down the effects of despair. Every 10 additional health slows down the rate at which Despair affects you.
    - 11: The morale booster from the drone will decrease the rate at which despair affects you.
    - 12: The trader has an effect. Being close to a trader will slow down and/or reduce your Despair.
    - 13: The perk “From the Shadows” also has an effect on the way Despair affects you at NIGHT. The more points in the perk, the less Despair affects you at night.
- Headshots! Zombies take maximum damage from headshots, however, they do take small damage if you miss the head.
- Zombies DON’T bleed. Nothing undead takes bleed damage.
- Hazmat zombies are a guaranteed source of hazmat gear. Kill one, and if it drops loot, it’ll have some hazmat gear in there.
- There are more zombies in the world. Biomes are gamestaged, which means zombies get tougher and their number increases as you level up.
- Zombies are tougher.
- Nights are dangerous, downtown is much more dangerous.
- Traders and vending machines are MUCH more expensive to buy from, and traders will buy from you at a much lower price.
- Crafting is 25% more expensive, and loot, harvesting and scrapping quantities are much lower.
- XP required to level increased by 25%.
- Dismember chance lowered to 1% per attribute level, max at 10%.
- Knife base damage rebalanced.

## AMMO, WEAPONS, MODS AND ARMOUR

- New basic wood arrow/bolt. Made from a single branch, its range is poor, its damage isn’t great, and it always breaks on impact.
- All arrows and bolts have a 25% chance of causing bleeding on a living target. Shame it doesn’t work on the undead…
- Ammo can be “dismantled” into its component parts.
- The serrated blade only fits on spears and knuckles now.
- Hazmat armour mods can be crafted. You’ll still need all four mods (head, gloves, outfit, and boots) for full radiation protection.
- New mods – blessed metal for stopping mutated regen. NiCd is back, as is Flaming Oil and Liquid Nitrogen.
- New clothing mod – cycling shorts. Install them in your leg armour/clothing and save 25% stamina when cycling.

## BLOCKS/WORKSTATIONS

- The beehive. Find bees (and honey) in specific tree stumps (beehives) in the world, and use them to produce honey. Normal wild tree stumps have a higher chance of giving honey too.
- The rain collector. Works like a dew collector, but requires an empty bucket to collect water.
- The chicken snare. Place this block down, and load it with corn seed to attract and trap chickens, which can be used in coops to produce eggs.
- These chickens can also be butchered for meat, feathers and eggs, with a hunting knife in your inventory.
- The chicken coop. Place this block, add a chicken from a trap, and it will produce eggs over time. The chicken will “dry out” over time, and will need replacing to keep producing eggs.
- The tablesaw cannot be crafted, it can only be collected from POIs. Press “E” to pick one up.
- The workbench now has slots for a wrench, hammer, ratchet, impact driver, and nail gun. These tools are needed to craft a lot of items, and some items have been moved from inventory crafting to workbench crafting.
- The cement mixer now requires gasoline to work.
- The forge no longer requires you to smelt items. You can use the items directly from your inventory, and a lot of items are crafted in batches of 5.

## BUFFS/DEBUFFS

- Snakes and Spider zombies will envenom you when they attack. Kill snakes to extract their venom, which can be used to make antivenom. Antivenom crafting is unlocked after reading 10 medical magazines, and it can appear in loot and trader stock.
- The Wasteland biome is irradiated, and very, VERY dangerous. You’ll need hazmat mods before you venture in there.
- Radiated zombies now irradiate the player when they attack. A full set of hazmat mods negates this.
- Some Burnt zombies now set the player on fire when they attack. A full set of hazmat mods negates this.
- Honey infection treatment reduced to 3% from 5%.
- Despair medication (Lavender, St. John’s Wort and Lithium) can be found in medical loot, and in trader stock. Lavender oil can be crafted from lavender flowers and used to treat despair.

## ZOMBIES/ENEMIES

- Bears and wolves are back in the forest.
- Hazmat zombies are now immune to burning.
- New Bunker Buster zombie. Only appears during bloodmoon(s), and can appear from the very first Bloodmoon. You’ll want to take it out quickly… think of it as a “light” demolition zombie.
- Demolition zombies appear at a much earlier gamestage.
- New Mutated zombie variant. Bigger, tankier, stronger, yellower, and with more radiated regen. You’ll need a blessed metal mod to take them down – the wasteland is full of these guys.
- New Frozen zombie variant. Slightly tougher, slightly slower, slightly more XP, and take slightly more damage than their “Normal” counterparts. Immune to the effects of liquid nitrogen, and if they touch you, your movement is reduced by 20%. You can negate this by maxing out the Well Insulated perk. Found in the snow biome.
- New Rotting zombie variant. They have lower HP, lower XP reward, and they take more damage. Found in the forest biome.
- New Cowboy zombie variant. Similar to “normal” zombies, these enemies are exclusive to the desert biome, identifiable by their cowboy hats and/or gun belts. They are hot to the touch, and getting hit by them will overheat you briefly.
- All “fatties” (Big Mama, tourist etc.) explode…
- During bloodmoons, ‘some’ zombies have a 10% chance to respawn after death, unless they’re killed with fire or explosives. There is also a 5% chance that a “boss” zombie will spawn, which boosts all zombies within range; their damage by 20%, and gives them regenerative properties. The boss is marked with a specific symbol, so target them with extreme prejudice.
- All “Fat” zombies (Cop, Big Mama and Tourist) are filled with a substance that’s irresistible to all zombies. If you are within range when they explode, they’ll cover you in this stuff – and attract other zombies. Cop and vulture vomit also has this effect.

## FOOD/FARMING

- All canned food found in loot, vending machines, and trader stock is “uncooked”. Cook it to make it safe to eat, or eat it and run the risk of food poisoning…
- Uncooked cans don’t replenish health, just food and water.
- Five new recipes – Chicken stew and chicken miso, top of the tier 3 food chain, along with Scrambled Eggs, a better use for eggs and Tramp/Vagabond stew(s), which use cat/dog food. Basic recipes, unlocked by default. Needs a cooking pot.
- MegaCrush is craftable, in a campfire, with a beaker, and cheaper in a chemistry station.
- Pies and cheesecake need honey for that sweet, sweet taste now.
- Crops’ growing time is double that of vanilla.
- Farming is reworked entirely. You need a hoe to till the ground to plant seeds. Use the hoe with fertiliser to upgrade the tilled ground. Fertilzed terrain yields 3 crops, same as a farmplot.
- Farm Plots require fertiliser and nails to craft, are crafted in the workbench with a hammer, and are the same fertile level as fertilised ground.
- There is no harvest bonus for Living off the Land, instead, seeds cost less crops to make per level, and the amount of fertiliser required to make farmplots is reduced per level. Fertiliser is craftable in the cement mixer and chem station, and is in **some** trader stock.
- Wild plants can be picked up – press ‘E’ by default to pick them up. Wild plants always give one crop, whether they’re picked up or “punched”.
- New plant – lavender. Purple flower found growing in the wild and in some POIs. Seeds crafted from lavender flowers, no unlock required. Lavender flowers can be found in loot and trader stock, and Lavender seeds in trader stock.

## PROGRESSION

- There is no more Daring Adventurer or Better Barter. Traders will give a drink after every quest tier, which will increase bartering by 5% and trader level by one for each tier of quests completed. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SPACE IN YOUR INVENTORY FOR IT!
- There is a new perk, Survival Instinct. It’s a “single-player” version of Charismatic Nature. 5 levels, each level gains you an additional 5 health/stamina, 10% block damage, 5% entity damage, 3% XP, and carry capacity increases by 1.
- Living off the Land now offers a discount to crops needed to make seeds.

## RESOURCES

- Trees no longer give wood, they give wood logs, scraps, and branches. Logs can be placed and then chopped with an axe for wood, or use the table saw to do it quicker and better.
- Primitive weapons and ammo are now made from wood scraps, branches, plant fibres, and/or stone.
- Cobblestone is now more expensive to make in your inventory. Use a cement mixer to make it cheaper.
- Concrete now requires a bucket of water and a new material, Feldspar. Concrete is crafted in batches of 250. Returns an empty bucket when crafting is complete.
- Most ammo can be dismantled into its component parts. Check ammo for recipes, and look at the 3rd tab to see what they dismantle into. Most need a workbench to do this, but basic arrows/bolts can be dismantled in your inventory.
- Repair kits are more expensive, and top tier weapons/armour/tools now require a specific repair kit.

## VEHICLES

- All vehicles EXCEPT the bicycle are too heavy for you to carry. Crafted vehicles come in a crate for you to carry to their deploy position.
- Two new vehicles, the Ruin Runner and The Hornet.
- The Ruin Runner is a dirt bike, with similar speed to the motorcycle, but the inventory capacity of the minibike. The Hornet is an off-road dune buggy. As fast as a 4×4, but with the inventory capacity of a motorcycle.
- Vehicles CANNOT be used underwater.

- The workbench now has slots for a wrench, hammer, ratchet, impact driver, and nail gun. These tools are needed to craft a lot of items, and some items have been moved from inventory crafting to workbench crafting.
- The cement mixer now requires gasoline to work.
- The forge no longer requires you to smelt items. You can use the items directly from your inventory, and a lot of items are crafted in batches of 5.

## BUFFS/DEBUFFS

- Snakes and Spider zombies will envenom you when they attack. Kill snakes to extract their venom, which can be used to make antivenom. Antivenom crafting is unlocked after reading 10 medical magazines, and it can appear in loot and trader stock.
- The Wasteland biome is irradiated, and very, VERY dangerous. You’ll need hazmat mods before you venture in there.
- Radiated zombies now irradiate the player when they attack. A full set of hazmat mods negates this.
- Some Burnt zombies now set the player on fire when they attack. A full set of hazmat mods negates this.
- Honey infection treatment reduced to 3% from 5%.
- Despair medication (Lavender, St. John’s Wort and Lithium) can be found in medical loot, and in trader stock. Lavender oil can be crafted from lavender flowers and used to treat despair.

## ZOMBIES/ENEMIES

- Bears and wolves are back in the forest.
- Hazmat zombies are now immune to burning.
- New Bunker Buster zombie. Only appears during bloodmoon(s), and can appear from the very first Bloodmoon. You’ll want to take it out quickly… think of it as a “light” demolition zombie.
- Demolition zombies appear at a much earlier gamestage.
- New Mutated zombie variant. Bigger, tankier, stronger, yellower, and with more radiated regen. You’ll need a blessed metal mod to take them down – the wasteland is full of these guys.
- New Frozen zombie variant. Slightly tougher, slightly slower, slightly more XP, and take slightly more damage than their “Normal” counterparts. Immune to the effects of liquid nitrogen, and if they touch you, your movement is reduced by 20%. You can negate this by maxing out the Well Insulated perk. Found in the snow biome.
- New Rotting zombie variant. They have lower HP, lower XP reward, and they take more damage. Found in the forest biome.
- New Cowboy zombie variant. Similar to “normal” zombies, these enemies are exclusive to the desert biome, identifiable by their cowboy hats and/or gun belts. They are hot to the touch, and getting hit by them will overheat you briefly.
- All “fatties” (Big Mama, tourist etc.) explode…
- During bloodmoons, ‘some’ zombies have a 10% chance to respawn after death, unless they’re killed with fire or explosives. There is also a 5% chance that a “boss” zombie will spawn, which boosts all zombies within range; their damage by 20%, and gives them regenerative properties. The boss is marked with a specific symbol, so target them with extreme prejudice.
- All “Fat” zombies (Cop, Big Mama and Tourist) are filled with a substance that’s irresistible to all zombies. If you are within range when they explode, they’ll cover you in this stuff – and attract other zombies. Cop and vulture vomit also has this effect.

## FOOD/FARMING

- All canned food found in loot, vending machines, and trader stock is “uncooked”. Cook it to make it safe to eat, or eat it and run the risk of food poisoning…
- Uncooked cans don’t replenish health, just food and water.
- Five new recipes – Chicken stew and chicken miso, top of the tier 3 food chain, along with Scrambled Eggs, a better use for eggs and Tramp/Vagabond stew(s), which use cat/dog food. Basic recipes, unlocked by default. Needs a cooking pot.
- MegaCrush is craftable, in a campfire, with a beaker, and cheaper in a chemistry station.
- Pies and cheesecake need honey for that sweet, sweet taste now.
- Crops’ growing time is double that of vanilla.
- Farming is reworked entirely. You need a hoe to till the ground to plant seeds. Use the hoe with fertiliser to upgrade the tilled ground. Fertilzed terrain yields 3 crops, same as a farmplot.
- Farm Plots require fertiliser and nails to craft, are crafted in the workbench with a hammer, and are the same fertile level as fertilised ground.
- There is no harvest bonus for Living off the Land, instead, seeds cost less crops to make per level, and the amount of fertiliser required to make farmplots is reduced per level. Fertiliser is craftable in the cement mixer and chem station, and is in **some** trader stock.
- Wild plants can be picked up – press ‘E’ by default to pick them up. Wild plants always give one crop, whether they’re picked up or “punched”.
- New plant – lavender. Purple flower found growing in the wild and in some POIs. Seeds crafted from lavender flowers, no unlock required. Lavender flowers can be found in loot and trader stock, and Lavender seeds in trader stock.

## PROGRESSION

- There is no more Daring Adventurer or Better Barter. Traders will give a drink after every quest tier, which will increase bartering by 5% and trader level by one for each tier of quests completed. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SPACE IN YOUR INVENTORY FOR IT!
- There is a new perk, Survival Instinct. It’s a “single-player” version of Charismatic Nature. 5 levels, each level gains you an additional 5 health/stamina, 10% block damage, 5% entity damage, 3% XP, and carry capacity increases by 1.
- Living off the Land now offers a discount to crops needed to make seeds.

## RESOURCES

- Trees no longer give wood, they give wood logs, scraps, and branches. Logs can be placed and then chopped with an axe for wood, or use the table saw to do it quicker and better.
- Primitive weapons and ammo are now made from wood scraps, branches, plant fibres, and/or stone.
- Cobblestone is now more expensive to make in your inventory. Use a cement mixer to make it cheaper.
- Concrete now requires a bucket of water and a new material, Feldspar. Concrete is crafted in batches of 250. Returns an empty bucket when crafting is complete.
- Most ammo can be dismantled into its component parts. Check ammo for recipes, and look at the 3rd tab to see what they dismantle into. Most need a workbench to do this, but basic arrows/bolts can be dismantled in your inventory.
- Repair kits are more expensive, and top tier weapons/armour/tools now require a specific repair kit.

## VEHICLES

- All vehicles EXCEPT the bicycle are too heavy for you to carry. Crafted vehicles come in a crate for you to carry to their deploy position.
- Two new vehicles, the Ruin Runner and The Hornet.
- The Ruin Runner is a dirt bike, with similar speed to the motorcycle, but the inventory capacity of the minibike. The Hornet is an off-road dune buggy. As fast as a 4×4, but with the inventory capacity of a motorcycle.
- Vehicles CANNOT be used underwater.

## About this mod

Jeff had this weird thought that he should take the idea from Crystal Hell mod (Thanks Shavick) and build upon the learn by doing system. Then along the way was like. ok I don't like the workbechs let's make our own and change how you craft them, Then out of the blue was like I don't like the weapons and how you craft ammo let's change that too, etc.

## Features

Detailed well as detailed as I can make it lit of changes.

- Removed magazines
- Removed skills and skill points everything is learn by doing, using and some crafting
- Workbench crafting is changed. You need to find items or the workbench itself in the world and craft or repair from that.
- Some workbenchs require s-core wireless power. Basically have to have a battery bank or generator running within 10 blocks.
- Cooking requires a propane camp stove and black propane tank. Fueled by a white propane tank (can be found in large tanks)
- Bulleted weapons have a special way they need to be dealt with.
    - Pistols skill must be level 50+ to unlock the ability to use a machine gun or shotgun
    - Machine guns must be level 50+ to unlock the ability to use a SMG.
    - Shotguns must be level 50+ to unlock the ability to use a rifle.
- only way to level a weapon is to use it.
- We added a weighted backpack system thanks to s-core. there are 4 backpacks. Civilian aka starter. Small, Medium and Large military
backpacks each level increases your carrying capacity. These are crafted by leveling your armor skills. Leveling armor can be done a few ways. By crafting cloth, letting your armor take damage and lastly by crafting armor mods.
- Biome protection is a thing. Each biome has a so called biome boss. They are tied to your trader reputation. While in the forrest
biome when you reach level 10 or higher you have a 3% chance every 5 minutes to spawn the forrest boss.
Each biome has a special ore. Forrest and burnt forrest is Nitrate. Desert is Oil shale and Snow is Iron. Make sure to read AOM V1.
- Speaking of trader rep. when you reach level 10 you also now have the ability to craft a trader Purchacing vending machine to place
in your base. Starting with trader Rekt.
- Time: time is a wonderful thing too bad you can't tell time. Waite loot a couch and see if you can find a blue cell phone.. Just
don't open it. you need it whole. Well atleast the first one.

## About this mod

The idea behind this mod is to slow progression, make traders less powerful, and generally extend the time for a playthrough, while keeping the vanilla look and feel.

## About this mod

This project started with myself taking over the [Farm Life Expanded](https://7daystodiemods.com/farm-life-expanded/) mod. I first start to fix thing with the mod but as I began to learn more about modding I decided that rather then trying to fix it would be best to rebuild. What started a “Farming” mod has now become so much more.

Welcome to “**The Age of Oblivion**”!

## About this mod

The Asia Mod is a far-reaching revision of 7 Days to Die. This overhaul mod has a very strong focus on survival. Therefore, you can not play this mod like the vanilla game or many other mods where you no longer have problems as soon as you can make bacon with eggs (by the way, these do not exist at all). But if you are willing to learn you find lots of detailed cooking recipes and lots of crafting possibilities.

Everything that is put in this mod has to fit the theme of Asia in the 16th century. (there is really a lot of research in here).

## About this mod

BTO is a comprehensive overhaul mod for *7 Days to Die* that significantly enhances and complicates nearly every aspect of the game, making it more immersive, challenging, and diverse.

The mod reworks biomes, turning environmental hazards like overheating or frostbite into life-threatening concerns rather than mere inconveniences. The Wasteland has become completely uninhabitable due to persistent, deadly radiation levels, requiring specialized protective gear to survive. However, venturing into this hostile zone is worth the risk, as it’s the only place to find titanium—a rare and incredibly durable metal that has surfaced there for unknown reasons.

To help you survive, BTO introduces a massive arsenal of weapons, crafted by the mod’s creator, RaDee, using models from open sources, as well as contributions from the renowned weapon pack creator Izayo. But that’s just the beginning. At the start of the game, you can choose your character’s backstory—soldier, farmer, wanderer, or more—each shaping your journey and skills, letting you decide who you’ll become in this post-apocalyptic world.

Become a legend with the mod’s legendary skill system, master crafting with an expanded crafting system, take to the skies by repairing a helicopter, or live a quieter life by the sea with an overhauled gardening and animal husbandry system.

This and much more awaits you in BTO.

## Features

Historical sites in 7 Days:

[**https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra_(Jordan)**](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra_(Jordan))

and

[**https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evenburg**](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evenburg)

This mod brings POIs to 7 Days that are based on actual historical

sites. Plus a few fantasy buildings, for example the sword “Excalibur”.It largely sticks to the vanilla rules in terms of gameplay, but brings drastically more difficult enemies for the late

game that scale to higher game days and challenges for the start of the

game that force the player to avoid threats or come up with something to

lure away the zombie hordes that are still invincible at the beginning.

The game has been enriched with enemies that are designed not to be

fought by the player at the start of the game: The “Server side Zombies

Plus” mod and the “Elite Zombies” mod have been included.The challenge of the mod is to deal with these opponents using vanilla means. The two zombie mods can also be found in many other

overhaul mods. There, however, drastically enhanced weapons are always

available compared to vanilla. This is not the case here in “Black

Forrest”: There are only vanilla weapons and tools, but drastically more

difficult enemies - right from the start. Only sporadically at first,

so you can avoid them. Later in masses. The mod is designed to scale up

the challenges for experienced players based on the vanilla game.

Zombie hordes really do literally deserve the name “horde” here. A wandering horde at night is a challenge like a blood moon.

Later in the game, the wandering hordes become welcome physical

exercises and suppliers of loot. The wandering hordes are not only a

challenge for the player, but also for the PC. The PC should not be

older than 2020 and should have a decent gaming graphics card, otherwise

the FPS drops during hiking hordes cannot be mastered.

In addition to challenges - they are peppered with zombie spawns - the new POIs also bring extra rewards for the daring

adventurer: In “Petra” and “Evenburg” there are built-in merchants that

become accessible after eliminating the zombie sleepers. There are a

number of hidden secret passages and switch puzzles in the Evenburg. A

variety of loot is hidden in the Evenburg, the Cave Tower and the Maze.

It can be worth suppressing the explosion of cops and demolishers - or

using them tactically to open up entrances.

List of modlets belonging to the Black Forrest:

POIs “Petra”, “Evenburg”, “Excalibur”, “Cave Tower”, “Maze”, “Chicken Run” from “Antipas”

AGF-V1-HUDPlus-1Main-v2.0.0 from “AuroraGiggleFairy”

Server side Zombies Plus from “Arramus” and “Oakraven”

Elite Zombies from “BlackRabbit”

Wanderhorde boost from “Antipas”

KHA21-HPBars + KHV1-60BBM from “Khaine”

## About this mod

Darkness Falls is not an easy mod. The primary intent is to drag out the early game, so it will take you longer than usual to get to Iron and Steel. Several things you are used to being able to make now require classes or perks to be purchased, and night-time is not fun time. The wasteland? Even less so.

This is a mod I originally created to fix a few "issues" myself, my wife and some friends felt the game had. Turns out I really enjoy modding so I've expanded on it quite a bit. The intent is to drag out the early game, so it will take you longer than usual to get to Iron and Steel. As I started playing in Alpha 8,  I wanted to try and bring back a few things from that era. Sharp rocks and sticks are pretty good examples of that, and I want to try and incorporate more features from that era of gameplay.

The behemoth, originally unveiled in A16 and then scrapped is alive and well in this mod, along with some extra friends. Expect to see new zombies, new horrors and don't anticipate an easy ride. A mostly comprehensive list of features can be found below.

## About this mod

In a dystopian world ravaged by zombies, robots were deployed with strict orders to eliminate any signs of life to try and contain the outbreak. As a result, many remaining survivors that had not been infected were wiped out and the animals that once roamed the grasslands became extinct. The year is now 2034 and the zombie outbreak still rages across the wastelands fuelled by a mysterious glow that keeps the undead alive. Inspired by sci-fi games such as Generation Zero, Prey and Detroit: Become Human.

## About this mod

This mod was designed to walk the line between realism and fun engaging gameplay. Where realism became grindy or not fun I tried to aim for engaging gameplay mechanics with a focus on risk and reward and a strong sense of consequences. Death in this mod is permanent with few exceptions. In this mod when death occurs your player data is wiped and you will respawn as a fresh new player

## About this mod

This is a work in progress mod, that adds 100+ new guns, 45+ types of ammo, 200+ new item modifiers and 70+ new items. It changes the vanilla mechanics drastically, extends the endgame and makes everything a bit harder, but not frustrating. All guns feature custom animations, visible attachments, grip poses, multiaction (underbarrel-launcher) etc.

## Features

- **Action Skills:** action skills replace the perks and perk books in the newest version, you can view them in your character stats windows (where your armor is for example). You basically learn by doing; shoot your weapon - learn your recoil control, go mining - learn your mining action skill and do more damage/harvest more ore, walk arround a lot - receive stamina bonuses, walk speed and better mobility trough your action skills. (Btw the perk window wasn't removed yet, so it might look confusing to you)
- **Gun Handling:** the gun stats were changed drastically and your recoil, aim time, return speed and other handling stats are now dependend mostly on bullet energy and gun weight. Heavier guns generally have less recoil, just like in real life and rifle caliber guns generally have much more recoil, than pistol caliber guns. Those values are impacted by action skills and attachments. For example, some muzzle compensators can decrease your recoil as much as 50%. Your gun stat button is right next to the action skill button. You need to hold a gun in your hand and it will show you detailed informations.
- **Progression & Trading:** Readable magazines, which previously teached you how to craft guns, modifiers and everything else have been entirely removed. Your new way of aquiring things are traders & loot. This change makes this mod much more trader-heavy. Just like in EFT, you will aquire most of your stuff from the traders now and the main progression factor troughout your gameplay will be money. To make everything feel smooth and ballanced, the economy has been reworked, playtested and ballanced out thorughly. Also challenges have been removed and the starter-challenge now basically only has the "Open Challenge Window", "Locate Trader" thing. The UI definetly requires some work.
- **Trader Specific Items:** to get along nicely with the economy & progression changes, traders now sell specific items. There is no in-depth guide at the moment, about what which trader sells, but every trader has specific weapons & modifiers, that no other trader sells. And generally, Hugh sells most guns, attachments and a lot of every single type of ammo, Rekt sells a lot of food and starter items, Jen - meds/chemical items, Bob - vehicles/melee/tools/construction/crafting and rare crafting items,  - high caliber guns/attachments and a bit of everything. Generally all traders basically sell everything. You just need the money.
    
    Barney
    
- **Schematics:** you might wonder, if readable magazines were removed, how you can learn to craft guns/attachments/others. Most items were made craftable by default, especially workstations/electrical/vehicles/and some more. Those are basically harder to craft now. For example the workbench now requires the rare new Toolset item to be crafted. Not everything was made craftable by default, for example some items require you to find following loot-only schematics: medications/injectors/liquor/explosives/car maintenace/chemist/counterfeit money/archer(ammo)/robotic(ammo)/armor. Those are the loot-only schematics, but don't worry: they were intentionally made to be looted easily. By day 20+- you are expected to find them all. Now the other kind of schematics are only craftable; those are required to learn how to craft weapons/attachments/AP or HP-ammo. Those schematics require the rare Toolset item to be crafted. Example: find/buy a round of 7.62x51 AP. Craft the 7.62x51 AP & Toolset into a schematic -> read schematic -> learn how to craft 7.62x51 AP
- **Removed:** in 1.0 all non-military looking armors were removed. The only kept armors are Athlete/Commando/Nomad, renamed to: Recon/Assault/Survivalist. All armor modifiers were removed. Stealth was removed. Sneak damage was removed.
- **General:** : the player damage modifier was removed from the difficulties. They were renamed and you can find more informations ingame. . You are expected to use NVG's , which there are T1-T3 now. Rekt sells a T1 at the beginning for cheap money. , making it quite hard to get away - but not in an annoying way, just keep your distance. This was done to prevent the weird "be in a tricky situation - just jum out of it" thing, I kept seing.  which you all probably know about by now, but they were supposed to be released only with 1.0 test version. They have armor levels 2-6 and durabilities. If your ammo has 40 penetration, you can penetrate level 4 armor. Durability can be damaged down, so even 10 penetration can penetrate a level 5 armor, when damaged enough. I'll eventually add a guide to how everything works, but leg-meta is working great anyways :D.  now has x100 stacks. .
    
    Difficulties have been reworked
    
    Nights are darker
    
    *(inspired by Nemesis)*
    
    Zombies now slow you down, when hitting you
    
    Armored Zombies
    
    Ammo disassembly
    
    Vanilla food items were removed
    
- **This is still a test version:** I am still frequently noticing some issues. Nothing game-breaking but some wrong localizations, minor inballances here and there, incorrect values and so on. Some food animations missing, some attachments not implemented yet, quest completion giving magazines as reward and probably more minor problems.

## About this mod

Forsaken Trail is a complete overhaul of the game and is the successor of Gnamod. The mod focuses on wilderness survival, exploration and improving the overal survival experience. This mod changes most of the game systems in an attempt to create something unique and it does not try to hold the player’s hand that much, making it quite challenging for anyone new to it. The world mostly decides the gamestage so going into higher level POIs or biomes may not be the wisest strategy because of this. You can find any item from the first day due to the unique way loot is generated where player level and gamestage only influence the amount you find.

The mod also comes with a unique character creation system where you select your attributes, skills and background before you spawn into the game. You will begin the game with gear and technology unlocked based on these choices. This gear in addition to a number of tutorial challenges will help you survive your first day and first week.

The zombies and animals in the world are all randomized, their walk, abilities and sizes will be decided the moment they spawn and are further influence by their type. You will encounter zombies that can puke or walk on all four legs. In the more natural biomes animals are more prevalent, while near cities and destroyed areas you will see a lot more zombies. Be careful around buildings as zombies will be awake and roaming around and they have keen ears.

## Features

The main feature of the mod is a series of custom biomes (40 in total) that are divided into 5 climate zones (Temperate, Wet, Warm, Cold and Irradiated). These come with a totally overhauled RWG that adds these features. Vanilla maps will not work with the mod, create a new one before playing.

The mod focuses on wilderness survival, overhauling food and drink and making the world far more interesting to explore.

Zombies and animals are randomized in size and behavior. Zombies in the world will only spawn once and when killed not come back. There are no night spawns, but wandering hordes are fully gamestaged.

Zombies in POIs will start to wander when the player comes close and if alerted may break out. Biome and POI tier decide gamestage of most spawns.

New resource and crafting system with quality levels up to 120. Quality is not permanent and lowers on repair, items break when not repaired.

New progression system with 5 attributes chosen on spawn via a new spawn screen. You choose a background and starting skills as well there, which decide what gear you spawn into the world with.

Crafting skills can be obtained through magazines and research papers. The research papers are unlocked via the Research perk and allow you to turn blueprints into a chance to increase your skill without the need to loot.

All firearms and bows are made up of 5 parts (the weapon and 4 mod parts). These decide how strong your weapon is and can be replaced for better parts you loot, buy or take from other weapons.

There are new challenges that are a tutorial to replace the vanilla challenges. These guide new players and give a focus for survival.

Traders are scattered in the wilderness, they do not offer any quests, instead you find bounty notes that give you a quest that can be turned in at any trader for hard cash.

Building is mostly done via blueprint blocks crafted from blueprints. These blocks usually require multiple ingredients to upgrade. The construction perk allows easier and faster construction while reducing stamina and durability use.

Character weight and inventory system allows you to use more slots from the start but also adds weight to every item. You can carry a lot of small items, but only a few fridges before being weighed down.

Many blocks in the world can be harvested from, picked up or otherwise interacted with without the need to bash them. Produce can be harvested from plants, honey searched in stumps and water can be taken directly or added to containers.

## About this mod

The idea of this modification has long been on the surface – to transfer the player from the realities of the US state of Arizona to an authentic town somewhere in the CIS (post-Soviet countries) with post-Soviet peculiar buildings.

In addition to houses, transport, weapons, and partially the appearance of zombies, and the interior will be redesigned. The gameplay, which is not related to the visual, will also undergo changes: there are plans to create new traps, including distracting ones; rebalancing weapons; creating new types (subspecies) of quests and creating quests of higher complexity than tier 5 or even 6; recoverable transport in the world; partial complexity of crafting and much more.

An additional idea of the mod is to make it only through xml, without additional programming and getting into the game code. There are two main reasons for this: I'm a bad coder; I don't want the mod to need special guides on how to install it, it should be enough to throw it into a folder – and that's it.

Some plans and ideas have already been tested, have prototypes, some are only in the "in theory it should work" stage. You can get acquainted with them, as well as with the general development plan below.

## Features

- Adjusted the light at night - it's still very dark, but if you raise the brightness to 100%, you can see the surroundings well.
- Completely redesigned tiles of cities and countryside, added straight sections, intersections, T-shaped intersections, dead ends, turns. There are no differences by district yet.
- New locations have been added to the city and countryside, blocks from A21 have been added, the correct difficulty levels have been configured, several locations have been made by subscribers, their nicknames are in the name of the locations.
- Almost all locations are adapted for the "Infection" quest, some of them have quests to restore electricity.
- 99% of interior doors have been replaced with vanilla ones in order to preserve the mechanics of door destruction.
- The locations of traders Jen, Hugh, Joel, Bob look the same, they are located only in cities. The location of the Rect is only in countryside areas, it looks different.
- Traders give out simple quests to collect resources in the "Small jobs" section, when available. The quest to collect resources begins through the exclamation mark of the quest at a distance of 100-255 meters from the trader. The reward is only dukes, but the quest counts in the series of the first difficulty.
- Reduced spawn of mushrooms, blueberries, and nests
- Birch trees have been temporarily removed
- Reduced loot in some locations, especially in countryside areas
- Different colors of zombies do not work in A21, but decorative items on zombie Bo and some others remained
- Added the item "Car chassis", necessary for crafting a car "Buhanka" (opens when reading 70 magazines of automotive mechanics)
- Added crafting of the "Buhanka" car – first you need to craft the frame (it opens the same way when reading 70 magazines), placed on the ground, improved with repair tools to the finished "Buhanka". Any frame can be picked up and placed, for example, to continue assembly in another place. It is not susceptible

to ranged attacks, only for melee combat.

- The "Buhanka" accommodates 4 people initially, 6 people – with a mod for additional seats. Mods for cars in the A21 do not work the way they worked in the A20, so they will be done differently.
- It is impossible to buy or find a chassis, a frame or a ready-made "Buhanka", only craft.
- The AK47 has a new model, reduced recoil, a change in appearance with different mods, the correct shooting from the front sight is configured, the crosshair disappears at the same time. The crafting has not been changed.
- The assault rifle model has been replaced with the AS VAL model, the recoil has been changed, some mods cannot be put on it, for example, a silencer, a drum magazine. The crafting has not been changed. The shots have a reduced noise, but they are not silent.

## About this mod

Six billion people on Earth when the infection hit...
The Krippin Virus had a 90 percent kill rate; that's 5.4 BILLION people, dead. Crashed and bled out. Dead. Less than one-percent immunity.
That left 12 million healthy people, like you. The other 588 MILLION turned into Dark Seekers, and then they got hungry, and they killed and fed on everybody. **EVERYBODY!**
Every single person that you or I has ever known is dead! DEAD!
**THERE IS NO GOD!**

Zombies (Dark Seekers) DO NOT spawn in the wild during the day. You are free to move about the world, but be warned...
Buildings are DANGEROUS. They are filled with fast-moving enemies, and you'll need to be careful when looking for supplies.
There are no traders; all trader compounds have been abandoned.
When night falls, you'll want to be inside and well hidden. Dark Seekers will be out in force, and they're hungry

## Features

### Changes From the Vanilla Game

As stated above, no zombies spawn outside during the day.

All buildings have a minimum of “infested” levels of zombies. This can be increased via a new game options tab, to super infested, or ultra infested.

Zombies move QUICKLY, ALL THE TIME!

Come nightfall, there will be 5x the number of zombies that you would normally see in vanilla.

Feral sense is ON at night, with 50% more range than vanilla. If you want to avoid Darkseekers, you’ll need to stay hidden and quiet.

There are NO TRADERS. You’ll need to generate a fresh map.

The chance of finding dew collector tools is DRASTICALLY INCREASED from vanilla. Not guaranteed from a broken dew collector, but a high chance.

Hybrid Action skills compliment most tool and weapon perks. 50% of the bonuses from perks are from perk points, and 50% from action skills.

Headlamps and nightvision goggles have been removed, as have T3 rifles, machine guns and shotguns.

Each abandoned trader compound has a custom “challenges” vending machine. Completed challenges award old cash.

Old cash replaces Dukes as the world currency. It can be used at vending machines to purchase challenge rewards, food, and drinks.

### Main Differences Between the Movie and the Mod

While Darkseekers will not SPAWN outside, they will chase you out of buildings, and follow you outside, regardless of the time of day.

Unfortunately, you don’t have a pet dog. Sorry.

You can’t “capture” a zombie to look for a cure. You just play the game as you normally would.

## About this mod

This mod is about 85% a joke, 10% serious, 5% butterscotch ripple. It has been an idea for years and is finally a realization. It literally started as a joke and grew from there. The mod has been made so that players can have a serious playthrough and not just log in for 5 minutes, have some laughs, and never play it again. Although some people might still do that. Rude!

## About this mod

Outback Roadies is an expansion for 7 Days to Die with an Australian theme.
The concept has a bit of a Mad Max type post-poco feel about it and includes a 7D2D version of 'The Compound' POI from Mad Max II.

## About this mod

Preppocalypse is an expansion for 7 Days to Die, from the perspective of a Prepper. In the context of 7 Days to Die, a Prepper is a survivor who prepared in advance for adverse situations and made it through the initial ‘event’ stage and aftermath. Preppocalypse places the player in the subsequent afterwards.

Due to vigilance from before the initial ‘event’, a Prepper already has some features in place. These include increased inventory capacity, enhanced skill potential and choice, and access to other benefits considered helpful for survival. Preppocalypse recognizes a Prepper has an increased chance to thrive. As a tradeoff, in addition to the grunt, feral, and radiated hostile classes, there are ‘others’ out there to provide a more challenging and hostile environment. They will mostly be seen as game stage progresses, but be prepared for some surprises during Horde Night or in the biomes. This expansion builds on the post-apocalyptic theme of 7 Days to Die through an additive approach. As such, the majority of features will be very familiar. Additions are intuitive, enhancing, immersive, in context, supportive, and appropriately more threatening. While there will be periods of extremes, considered choices can restore balance.

## About this mod

Welcome to Ravenhearst a place where your nightmares grow and fester and the world around you is trying to kill you at every turn. Ravenhearst is a full overhaul mod that uses the amazing 7 Days to Die and turns expectations in its head. Every aspect of the vanilla game has been tweaked or tuned to increase challenge and difficulty. Ravenhearst has often been called the mod that is not for everyone. It is best played by those that have a basic understanding of the vanilla 7 Days to Die experience, and for those looking to challenge themselves. Below you will learn just a little bit about what we have to offer. Keep in mind that Ravenhearst, just like the actual 7 Days to Die game, is nowhere a near finished experience and it's development is ongoing, and as such should be played with the open mind that there can be major updates that will cause save breaks and resets to your game. We pride ourselves on using our team of testers to thoroughly play and beg test so that we can provide you with the most solid gaming experience we can manage to put forth. But also keep in mind as with anything, things can happen.

## Features

**All the Worlds a Stage**

The ENTIRE game is now gamestaged. Until gamestage 5, you will see slightly weaker versions of zombies in the world, helping to bridge the gap into Ravenhearst. The incredibly talented @Yakov and @Redbeardt  has enabled me the chance to gamestage every aspect of the game. Wilderness Spawns, Wandering Hordes, Biome Spawns, Night Time Spawns ALL of it is now set according to your gamestage. Night Terrors do not spawn pre Gamestage 50. Gamestage tiers are as follows:

**GS1 - Normal Zeds**

**GS100 - Tier 2GS300 - Night Terrors and Special Zombies**

**GS500 - Tier 3**

**GS700 - Tier 4**

This ensures you do not get overwhelmed and also that the challenge increases as your level increases

**The Night Bleeds**

The nights in Ravenhearst are full of disgusting creatures and terrifying sounds. Night Walkers are zombies who seek blood and are faster than a normal zombie. But fear not they disappear by morning... until you grow stronger. As your gamestage increases so do the chance that they will remain in the world!

**Yakov and Redbeard's Suite of DLL Harmony Tweaks**

It goes without saying that Redbeard and Yakov has been a major driving force behind Ravenhearst. They have designed a host of dll tweaks to game mechanics to increase difficulty and functionality. Here is a sampling of what They have done:

- **Anti Nerd Poling -**

No longer can you jump and place frames. You have to plan out your builds with ladders and other blocks now. More realistic and challenges people to come up with new ways of overcoming challenges

- **Recipe Ingredient Limit Removal -**

Recipes can now have dozens of ingredients so we are no longer restricted to 5. If a recipe has MORE than 5 there will be an arrow below the description you can click. It will scroll through the pages of ingredients.

- **Blood Moon Vehicle Disabled -**

Our mod introduces challenges we expect players to face. Vehicles will become disabled on Horde Night. Bicycles will still work. Think of red moon and horde night like an EMP bomb, electricity is whacked during it.

- **Recipe Count Memory -**

A configurable option in our menu allows you to remember the last amount of a crafted recipe quantity. So if you made 100 wood, the next time you open it it will read 100. This can be turned off via options.

- **Skill Points Bonus -**

You will now gain 2 Skill Points every 10 levels as a boost to your perks. You can use these points just like any other and they are automatically added. So every 10 levels you have something to look forward to!

- **Gamma Limiter -**

This may cause some controversy but we have set a limit on Gamma to 75. The reason for this is we have noticed players jacking their gamma up so they can see in house and at night. Some of these pois were designed with shadowy dark corners in mind. A little gamma bump is ok but bumping to 100 defeats the work put in by our POI makers. This is till open to some editing and tuning.

- **Trader XP Removal -**

You will no longer level your Player by selling items. This is a gameplay decision made by me. I want actions to count for your level not selling to traders. Other aspects of traders are the same... for now

- **Modified Descriptions**
- Now the station something is crafted in and the tool you need are automatically displayed at the end of every description. Descriptions will also display the number of slots an item has.
- **Airdrop Spawning -**

Zombies will now spawn dependent on gamestage at airdrops. You will have to fight your way to the airdrop through a horde of undead.

- **The Final Stand -**

After you finish your Class and Journal Quests, you will start a long final stand against the Undead. This includes special spawns, Blood Moons and more surprises. Do not start this undergeared!

- **Quest Crafting Warning -**

A message will display if you leave a table while crafting an item needed to complete a quest.

- **Reverse Rotation -**

QoL addition that allows you to reverse a rotation on blocks placed using LeftShift and LeftMouseClick.

- **Stash Backpack -**

The original stash backpack you know and love designed. Click "X" to lock any slot you want in your backpack and move same items to boxes with a simple click. These options save on exit unlike Vanilla.

- **Vehicle Pickup Disable -**

Realistic weights on vehicles. You can no longer pick up and store your heavy vehicles. Bicycles can be picked up. Be careful while driving and prepare to dig a vehicle out if it is stuck.

**All New Game Options**

You can set quest fetches to show indicators on the map, enable headshots only mode, control the size and frequency of wandering hordes, increase range zombies can see you at and enable or disable rage. These settings work on servers as well and a config.yaml file is included in the Mods/0-RHCore Folder.

- **City Zombie Multiplier -**

Zombies will now spawn around groups of pois, making cities dangerous. You can control the multiplier in settings

- **New Video Options -**

Field of view setting, show crosshairs, change the color of crosshairs or completely disable activation texts for a true clear Hud

- **Enable/Disable Custom Font -**

Redbeard has selected a gorgeous font for our mod but we understand some may find it hard to read so you can no enable and disable it in options.

- **PermaDeath Mode -**

You can now enable and disable a perma death mode from the RH menu. This adds a permanent death using Wellness.

- **Wellness -**

Wellness makes it's return to 7 Days. Eat the right food and water to increase your stats. Dying will reduce your Maxes down to 50. Build it back up by consuming better food and drink.

- **Active Ingredients -**

You can now click an ingredient in the recipe list to link you to how to make that ingredient. He has also created a fantastic transparent paper doll that pops up to let you know you have armor that needs to be repaired (below 50%).

- **Crop Damage -**

Zombies will now trample your crops and plants. So make sure you protect them at all costs.

- **Sphereiicore is also used as is his Take and Replace and disable trader protection. That's right, traders are always open but no longer are invulnerable!**

**Living Off The Land**

Farming has received an overhaul. Farm plots are now an end game goal and allow you to grow underground. Water is required for the plots to grow. The Farm Table is where you can craft seeds from crops or from seed packs you find out in the world. We have added back in Fertilizer, the Composter and yes Turds. Fertilizer made from the compost can be used on existing crops to increase yield. When destroyed, the crop returns to an unfertilized state, to be fertilized again. Ground farming with a hoe has been brought back! Water will now deplete as your crops grow. You can work towards an irrigation pipe system. Irrigation will prevent water from being depleted. Multiple new crops have been added like wheat, tomatoes, lettuce and more and these crops have been integrated into recipes new and old.

**Infection Matters**

When you are infected it will now kill you within 3 days. You MUST find a cure for your infection. It will persist through death. If you do not find a cure it will kill you. Chewing glass no longer represents a cure. Beehives can be made once the schematic is found. Tree stumps in the world have a chance to drop honey combs which can be crafted into honey to lower infections. This zombie apocalypse is very real and very dangerous.

**Too Much Too Soon**

Loot has undergone a complete rebalance (and may again in future versions) so that you are not swimming in loot early game. Scavenging and exploring now matters as you hunt for the best weapons and tools. Loot lists have been readjusted so they make more sense to what you would find in them.

**From My Cold Dead Hands**

In the ongoing quest to preserve what we love about 7 Days, we have readded some pulled game mechanics. Parts for guns are as they were with each firearm having specific parts you need to find to assemble a weapon like frames, handles and cylinders. More returns to former mechanics loved by many is ongoing for future updates.

**Progression that means Progressing**

Levelling has been slowed down quite a bit to give the old way of doing things more prominence. You need to get out there and work those quests and use those weapons. All main attributes are now Player Level dependent. Perks have been rebalanced so as not to give the appearance of a character becoming Superman by Perk 5 of everything. Progression becomes way more exciting with the addition of unlockable recipes for every Action Skill. Every 20 levels of a skill will offer an unlock of a tool and weapon to that specific skill. So as you level and increase your Action Skills you will learn more recipes from the skill you are perfecting.

**Actions Speak Louder than Perks**

Action Skills have returned. You will receive a slight bonus in stats every time you level an Action Skill. This is Learn by Doing. Use axes and picks to level Construction, Bows to level Archery, Blades to level.... well Blades. You can keep track of your Action Skills progress on the skills screen.

**Quality Control**

Quality has been returned to 7 Days to Die. Each tool and weapon now has a quality level. 1-1000. Each 20th level is considered next tier and every single item has had stats attached to them so that finding new weapons and tools is no longer a boring process. Loot is exciting again! Find level 72 pickaxe, but know there are better out there. This will promote leveling as well as scavenging. But beware. You will need to increase your main Construction Skill because every repair will cost you 100 Quality Points. Every 20 levels of Construction Skill will drop that by 20 points. So Construction Level 20 will drop the penalty to 80 QP. Const Level 40 will drop it to 60 QP Loss and so on.

**Better Watch That Weapon Boy**

Along with Quality returning we have Degradation returning as well! Your weapon and tool will now degrade by 100 Quality Levels each time you repair it at the start. On top of this we've taken care of any mods that are in your item or weapon. If when repairing a weapon the quality reduction results in a lose of a mod slot any mod in that lost slot will be placed in the players inventory. Be careful to have a spare slot though as a full bag and inventory will result in the mod falling on the floor! So how do you salvage this? By leveling the Action Skill for the weapon and tool you are repairing. Each 20th level of your Action Skill after level 20 reduces that number by 20. So level 21 in Action Skill  you will lose 80 Durability and so on. A true progression system.

**The Home You Have Always Dreamed Of**

Ravenhearst likes to pride itself on being a builders dream mod. We have added dozens of new deco items for you to craft and decorate with, a number of new player storage options, movie posters you can collect, art you can collect, TV's, holiday items, playable radios and record players as well as made previously unavailable vanilla deco items accessible for crafting in our Decor Table. We are constantly adding new items as well.Apart from over 50 new deco blocks i have also created several new block placeholders for poi makers. From new corpses to arcade and slot machines to miscellaneous trash decos like liquor bottles and posters and potted plants, new mail box and trash can placeholders, now POI builders who wish to make RH specific pois can design them with variety in mind.

**Film Buff**

You will find many collectible posters in the world, ranging from movies to TV shows to art pieces. The selection is ever changing ad growing and fit perfectly in the basement of your shelter!

**Backpacks**

The backpack perk is now gone. In its place are backpacks that you can find in the world that unlocks three slots at a time to your inventory. These can be found in dressers, semis and other clothing related loot spots.

**The Journal**

We have introduced a quest based player journal that will take you on a questline all while teaching you the basic added mechanics of Ravenhearst. If you complete all the chapters of this journal you will receive exclusive recipes to craft some pretty cool items. The journal is not meant to be rushed through, rather it is meant to compliment your journey so do not worry too much about finishing it immediately.

**Starvation**

Food and water have undergone a major rework. Food values have been rebalanced, new food added, animals rebalanced for their meat yields and now they give red or white meat. Water is also now contaminated and you will need to build a water filtration unit to decontaminate it before you can drink it safely.

**POI Wonderland**

We have added many new POIs from around the 7 Days Community as well as Khaine and Cpt Krunch PEP Pack which contains some VERY familiar places to fill our world with unique buildings. From zoos to parks to airports and police stations there is always something new to find in our world.

**You Have Some Red On Ya**

Zombies come in many forms. We have added additional looks to zombies. Higher tiered zombies will sound and look different so you can tell them apart.

**Complex Crafting**

Ravenhearst has always been about more realistic crafting and this version is no exception. At start you are given a Personal Workbench. This is your hub for all things crafting. The backpack has very limited recipes, just the absolute basics. You will need to carry this table with you. It can be picked up easily by destroying it. We have added workbenches and stations such as the Farm Table, the Armor Bench, The Ammunition Table, The Water Filtration Unit, Survival Campfire, Mechanic Bench, Research Table and the Decor Table, all with its own uses and recipes. This will help you find what you are looking for better and also spice up that basement work area. Along with the stations, there are complex recipes such as tool heads for crafting tools, molds for forge crafting and vehicle parts. Vanilla recipes have all been changed to reflect new materials such as screws, tarps, twine and recipes like concrete and cobblestone have been made more complex.

**Vehicular Homicide**

We have reworked how vehicles are made completely. You will need to find engine parts and more from harvesting vehicles with the crowbar. There is now an Mechanic Bench and those are used to construct parts. You will have to build chassis from scratch using parts like car seats, alternators, sparkplugs and more. We have also added over a dozen new vehicles for you to collect such as community favorites from bdubya like the Box Truck and Jeep! All of these vehicles have their own unique assemblies and parts.

**Barnes and Noble? Where!**

All schematics now scrap into Knowledge Points, which can be used with Ink found in the world in the Research Desk to craft any missing recipes and perk books. There is also a set of limited edition novels you can find in the world made by sinder that scraps into some paper for you to use. True collectors may find value in finding all of the novels left in the world. Some book stores or Research Facilities may have remnants of working Research Desks so make sure to search all of them.

**Radiation**

You will notice green smoke filled areas on your journey. This represents a Tier 5 POI that is radiated.

There is no way to explore these without a hazmat suit, which can then be upgraded to an Wasteland hazmat suit that will allow you to explore the Wastelands! Inside you will find military crates and chests that house end game weapons, tools, schematics and resources that can not be found in normal areas. Do not tackle these pois too early though. They are extremely dangerous.

**Spoilage**

Food spoilage makes it's return. Find coolers to reduce spoilage time. You can can your vegetables and wrap your meat but it comes at a cost. Ingredients can be saved this way but cooked dishes WILL spoil so get a fridge or freezer to make them last longer. This is optional and can be removed before starting a new game by removing the ZZ_OtherModlets_Food_Spoilage_khzmusik_Optional folder

**Fire Spreading**

Burnt zombies and fire spitting zombies can burn down your homes! Make sure you find a fire extinguisher and keep ammo for it handy. You will need to put out fires. This is optional and can be removed before starting a new game by removing the ZZ_OtherModlets_gupFireMod_Optional folder.

**They Have Mutated**

Once you get to Gamestage 300 there will be a host of new Terrors to deal with. From zombies that crazily fire guns to fire spitting vultures and zombies dropping Molotov's in copters, your bases need specially reinforced! You have time but get busy! This is optional and can be removed before starting a new game by removing the ZZ_OtherModlets_ServerSideZombies_Optional folder.

**Sleep Through It**

Sleeping is a new mechanic and can be done on al nights except Blood Moons. Craft an alarm clock and it can be use to pass the nights, even on servers.

## About this mod

What Scavengers is is a tribute to traditional and classic zombie horror survival. If Ravenhearst is the Resident Evil of mods then Scavengers will be the Night of the Living Dead. Its focus is not on horde nights, or Demolishers, or even mutations but will be on primitive survival tactics, hordes of unrelenting WALKERS and respectful of established "traditional" zombie lore (no runners, headshots kill etc).

The challenge of this mod for me as we go forward is to make it as difficult as possible yet be something completely unexpected and different than what you would expect from 7 Days. We have Ravenhearst for the kitchen sink type of mod, this will be sleeker, meaner and rely more on natural challenges than things like bullet sponges. Building will not be the focus here, rather will be a luxury. Nomadic gameplay style and smart survival decisions will be key to your survival. Zombies will be enhanced with several new "sniffing out" techniques that could very quickly spell trouble for you in short order if you get overwhelmed. The gameplay will feel very similar in style to older Alphas, with less focus on points and perks and way more focus on crafting, resource gathering and scavenging of course.

## Features

Traditional Zombies. Walk Only, Headshot Only, No Ferals or Demos etc, minimal climbing or jumping, realistic damage. Danger comes in numbers.
-Fewer resources from everything
-Increased ingredient requirements on recipes
-Perks are available for now but will soon be removed
-LBD system where stats increase with tool and weapon usage not perks
-Reduced loot
-Wilderness style maps
-NO traders quests. Traders now give you work instead of fetch and clear quests. Infestations are still here but more difficult to clear.
-NO technology like turrets gyrocopter etc. This is not Fallout
-Traditional farming returns. No planters
-Increased crafting timers where they make sense
-Costs of repairing and upgrading increased (soon to be replaced by special kits)
-Removed surface ores
Backpack storage and encumbrance drastically rebalanced. Primitive Pockets and bags now exist and you need to craft or find schematics for bigger backpacks you actually wear.
Zombies hit HARD!
-Along with that new system come a host of changes like 3 mod slots ONLY, no more recipe unlocks via perks you MUST find schematics and more. That is right looting schematics is back!
-Workbenches and stations are no longer crated from normal parts, but from special station specific parts wrenched from the specific workstation or found in loot. These parts are used to craft the proper bench.
-NO working benches in the world. Harvest them to build your own.
-Minimal crafting. Create only what you logically can. You must loot those guns and fireaxes. Resources and components will need to be harvested and looted only.
-Vehicles will be scattered in the world and not craftable. You need to make vehicle repair kits in order to use them and you need to find fuel to fuel them before you can take one. Many new wrecks and driveable vehicles will be available.
-Pick up able objects in the world like deco instead of crafting them. Take home what you see!

## Features

- This is the most modular approach to modding you will see for a 7DtD ModPack. Unlike other Overhaul Lists that add things not all players like, you have complete control over what mods to enable/disable in your game to suit your own play style by using ModOrganizer2 (MO2).
- Unlike other Overhaul ModPacks, you are not learning a new game. Yet, it still feels like a fresh experience.
- This Mod List is not about overhauling major systems, nor adding too many new features. This list is all about improving dozens of small details that as a whole make for a better overall experience of the original game.
- Most of the mods in this collection are Quality of Life (QoL) improvements to give the players a nice Vanilla+ experience without any game breaking balance issues you see in some other mod lists.
- **Balance is subjective.** Some people think this Collection makes the game too easy. If you feel that way, disable the mods you don't like, and/or play with harder difficulty settings.

## About this mod

This mod was designed to walk the line between realism and fun engaging gameplay. Where realism became grindy or not fun I tried to aim for engaging gameplay mechanics with a focus on risk and reward and a strong sense of consequences. Death in this mod is permanent with few exceptions. In this mod when death occurs your player data is wiped and you will respawn as a fresh new player.  Choosing Your Character - Upon starting, players will have Knowledge Points available to purchase up to 3 Traits, a Hobby and a Profession.  These choices will determine the players starting stats, items and recipes. Players are able to learn all Professions over time by collecting 20 Profession Pages and crafting another Professions Kit. An additional Hobby can be learned after 20 days survived. Traits do not stack and are optional. The following are the Players Starting Choices.

## About this mod

Undead Country was made with the intention of changing the mostly dead world with only a few zombies outside, to a zombie infested country. Cities are huge and and in every biome. Guns are easier to get and looting POIs is more rewarding than quests. There are new tiers of zombies and quests to kill boss zombies.

## Features

If you’ve never played the mod - do it right now

Completely redesigned user interface with a lot of quality of life improvements such as advanced item stat readouts, dynamic UI elements like automatically hiding tool belt, advanced ranged weapon and tool stats on the HUD, speedometers for vehicles and more, all with various levels of customization in video options (Options -> Video -> User Interface -> Undead Legacy)
Encumbrance system
The new system adds weight to all items and blocks with scrolling inventory for player, vehicles and storage containers and
instead of unlocking new slots through progression, you increase your carry capacity limit instead, toolbelt and equipment slots are also counted towards that limit. When encumbered your ability to move and jump degrades. Vehicles when encumbered cannot move at all and player weight is also calculated into vehicles total encumbrance limit.
This was a crucial change to support potentially unlimited amount of custom items and blocks in upcoming future content,
allowing you to carry around lots of different things without worrying too much about limited inventory slots.
Sorting and searching in inventory or storage
You now will have the ability to sort inventory and containers by either weight, price, type or name as well as search through them to highlight the item you want to find.
Research System
Unlocking new schematics or quality upgrades no longer will be bound to player skills/perks by introducing multiple
tier research system with different research workstations, that allow gradually to progress through the game
by unlocking what you want and when you want without feeling that pressure of wasting those valuable skill points.
Any schematics, recipes or blueprints you find in the world, that you don't need can now be scrapped into new and
precious primary resource - research data, which is the key ingredient in researching upgrades, giving you a new option
on what to do with schematics, that you already know other than selling or scrapping them to paper.
Advanced and Expanded Crafting
Gotta Craft 'em all! A lot of the crafting recipes will feature intermediate crafting components as well as recipes,
that can go up to 12 different ingredients to craft them, bringing in more believable, immersive and less
arcade like crafting system!
New Vehicles
Alongside vanilla vehicles Undead Legacy will feature a variety of new early, mid and late game vehicles to help
Your journey through the harsh wastelands of 7 Days
New ways to interact in the world!
Always wondered who puts murky water jars in toilets and sinks or gas cans in gas stations or when wrenching cars?
Introducing new way of interacting with all kinds of water, fuel and other sources! With the new interaction method
you have to have some kind of empty container to be able to fill it up with the given substance, either it's a plastic
bottle for that sweet Fresh Water from a dispenser, Murky Water from those sink faucets or Gasoline from
gas station pumps or gasoline barrels.
New guns, melee weapons and tools!
Features a variety of new guns, melee weapons and tools and more will be added over time
Punch plants to harvest? NO!
Tired of punching crops, flowers and plants just to harvest them? Well this feature is coming back with Undead Legacy
with supporting perk bonuses such as from Living off the land perk and more! Punching them is still an alternative option.
New Lockpicking System
New Lockpicking System featuring a minigame similar to fallout series
Action skills are back and better than ever
Tired of feeling that gaining just plain old experience is not enough? Well, with action skills you are always
leveling up something and becoming better at that. Some Action skills unlock special perks when certain
milestones are reached.
RGB Lights
Fancy decorating your base with something more than just yellow light emitting candles or those bright
and annoying electrical lights? Now you can! Most electrical lights support full RGB customization with
additional parameters to tweak the lights range, intensity, make them pulse etc.
Abandoned and repairable vehicles
Not all things have to be made from scratch, therefore in Undead Legacy you can find damaged,
badly damaged or even repairable bicycles, minibikes, motorcycles, cars, trucks and more!
And more!

## About this mod

This Mod changes around 90% of the Total game Mechanics in the sense of Code, It adds many weapons All of which have been bought from various stores to try to get the best looking and playing Mod he can manage, Its constantly being worked on and improved and should always be kept upto date with the latest version of the main core game, The AIO also adds many Blocks and Different items that require abit more learning in order to understand how it all works, A good example of this is the main weapons are no longer repaired using the default repair kits but instead use 4 Custom made varients that are crafted on the player to do with each type of gun. Some of His Original Modlets that were used to create this AIO are as follows. Around 20 or so more have been added directly to the AIO that cant be made into Modlets due to them needing certain bits of code from the AIO so would cause Conflicts

## About this mod

War3zuk Farmlife 2025 Vanilla Install V1.4 B8 (This is a standalone installer version and is NOT to be used along side my main War3zuk Overhaul)

This Mod is a complete overhaul and update of the original Farmlife from alpha 17 that was discontinued when it became so out of date it was un-usable.. This overhaul has a complete array of custom trees, Plants And its own models all paid for by myself so that the mod is as nice looking as possible.. You have a full selection of Seeds, Fruits, Berries and so on so you can make lots of different types of foods to compliment the main game.You can craft and build an entire farm along with custom animals, Benches and so on. Learning curve is a little steep but well worth it if your into Farming

## Features

## SPIFSAL System

**Wasteland** uses a progression system similar to vanilla, but with a few changes:

- Each player is given 21 SPIFSAL points at the beginning of a game. These are for core attributes **only**.
- You are **required** to use all 21 points in order to outfit your character to start playing. Once you use them the black fades away and you can start playing as normal.
- Skill points are gained per level as vanilla and are used only to upgrade perks. Each perk level has both a skill point **and** player level requirement, which can be seen by hovering over the lock icon for each perk level.
- Once all your SPIFSAL points have been used, the only other ways to boost an attribute level is through wearing the proper clothing items(glasses/bandanas/etc), finding a rare SPIFSAL book in loot(permanent +1 to the book’s attribute) or rare power armor statues(permanent +1 to the book’s attribute).You can gain a temporary boost using certain drug items, just be aware of their side effects.
- Fergit’n Elixir can be used to respec and will give you your 21 SPFISAL points back. It isn’t cheap though.
- There have been a few changes to the perk trees, with some vanilla perks either reworked or removed outright. Several new perks have been introduced, such as New Age Cowboy for energy weapon types. Make sure to check each attribute’s associated perks so you know where you wanna spend those SPIFSAL points!

## New Enemies

There are several new enemies added into the game, from additional zombies to mutants and raiders!

- There are a bunch of new zombie models added, several with multiple color variants for a good variety. There are normal zeds, feral and rad versions, even a couple unique ones like the fisherman! There are also a few cop and demo types, but they aren’t as obvious as their vanilla counterparts, so keep an eye out!
- The wildlife has also been expanded to include mutant hounds, giant scorpions, and several pesky insects. More additions are coming!
- Zombies are no longer the biggest threat though, as there are several new types of enemies to be worried about. You will encounter both melee and ranged versions of raiders, a hostile group who attack first and loot second. They have a few POIs they call home, so never assume any house is safe!
- Soldier PMCs are also sweeping the area for supplies and will gladly relieve you of yours if they spot you.
- Mutants are genetically engineered horrors that are easy to spot, but hard to kill. Early game it is best to avoid most of these at all costs, especially the ranged enemies as they will wreck you. Melee guys can be taken out with some planning, but don’t underestimate them! There is also word of some even larger behemoths that are rarely spotted in the wild, which hit like a truck and need heavy firepower to manage to bring down.
- There are a few other enemies you might come to encounter, so always keep your eyes open!

## New Items

There are also tons of new items added to the game such as weapons, ammo, foods, medical items and more:

- There has been a whole arsenal added to the game, from melee weapons to scrap pipe weapons to shotguns and rifles. Loot or craft a 1911, BAR, Vector, SCAR, combat shotgun just to name a few. You will always have a few options at almost every tier of weapon.
- Melee weapon options have been expanded for all types: replace your bone knife with a cleaver, or swap your club for a rolling pin. Pipe wrenches, batons, pitchforks are all available to you. And don’t forget the skull-crushing Supa Sledge!
- Energy weapons are also available. There are both laser and plasma types, from pistols to rifles and more. There are also some bigger energy weapons as well, like the laser gat or the plasma caster. They have a similar progression to normal weapon types and have their own crafting magazine series.
- There is a line of heavy weaponry as well, from the harpoon rifle to the Fat Man! These offer superior firepower, but can slow movement until you invest more in their perks.
- A few new explosive weapons are available. Bottlecap mines, Nuka grenades, and M79 launchers will help level the playing field…literally.
- You will also find a loot-only group of .50 cal weapons. The .500 Magnum, Beo-50, and AS-50 cannot be crafted outright, unless you manage to find a broken version, but give you a reason to get out and loot.
- New ammo types for weapons been added. 10mm, 5.56, MFC ammo, Plasma cells. Ballistic ammo also has the HP/AP variants. Energy ammo has Max and Bulk versions for some variety.
- With fire spreading being enabled, there is a lootable fire extinguisher and its ammo that is used to repair it. Keep one handy, especially if your base is made out of wood.
- Drug items can be looted or crafted. These can be used to temporarily boost certain attributes, but can carry some bad side effects. Try and not get addicted.
- Food has been expanded to include several new Wasteland dishes. Carve up those mutant hounds, scorpions, or other critter to be able to make these new meals. Scrambled Hunter eggs or deathclaw souffles are just a few options.
- Power Armor can help keep you in one piece. Loot only so keep an eye out for power armor stands. Power armor uses frame piece which you wear like normal armor pieces, and then each piece(helmet, chest, etc) or the armor installs into the frames like a cosmetic mod. Currently only visible in third person.
- There are legendary versions of several weapons, and a set of power armor. These have better stats and usually unique textures. They may also provide extra bonuses or effects.

## Additional POIs

Currently this mod includes a handful of custom POIs. Some are vanilla ones that have been repurposed, others are completely new.

- Trader POIs can be destroyed
- Mutants have taken over several run down business POIs. Keep an eye out for meatbags and cages.
- Raiders and soldiers have occupied several different types of POIs. For now these don’t look much different than a normal POI, so be careful.
- Several custom POIs, from the Nuka Factory to the secret Nav-Tek Research Facility. Some have multiple versions that can change what is inside. Easter eggs and mini quest lines may exist is some of these, so pay attention.
- Radiated POIs exist in the world, and are used in **Clear Radiation** quests. Without either a set of power armor with a rad resistant mod installed or a full hazmat suit, these POIs will kill you quickly. Most, but not all, will have the yellow signs to warn you of the dangers.

## Gameplay Changes

While some things are still the same as vanilla, some things aren’t. Here are a few noteworthy changes to be aware of:

- Crafting magazines no longer affect crafting quality and just give temporary bonuses to their items. There is a Crafting Perks tab that unlocks your crafting skills now.
- Almost all items have a schematic that will also unlock them, and for items that have a quality level you can reread schematics to increase the quality level you can craft. Schems will only unlock Q5 though, so you still need at least one perk level to craft Q6 items.
- There are a few new/expanded illnesses. Rad poisoning is as deadly as getting infected. Being cold or hot for too long will eventually give you a cold or heatstroke. Take care of yourself.
- Critical injuries, such as concussions or fatigue, no longer instantly cure when using meds. It will take a short, but random amount of time for those things to heal.
- Weapons and armors typically use their respective parts to repair them.
- Vehicle crafting is no longer an option. Repairable wrecks out in the world or traders are the only way to get a working vehicle. Scavenge various parts, as well as unique ones that each vehicle needs to be repaired. Each vehicle has several stages until you finally can upgrade it into a working vehicle. Wheels also cannot be crafted, so either buy or loot then, or try harvesting intact wheels you find in the world.(Ones with rims, not just tires.)
- Picking up vehicles is disabled, except for the bicycle and minibike. Carrying either of those will slow your movement though.
- Farming has also been overhauled a bit. Seeds require a nearby water source in order to plant in farm plots. So either get a bucket and bring water to your farm, or build an irrigation system with the new water pipes to carry water to where you need it. Water is consumed over time, so one bucket won’t last forever. Pipes have valves and sprinklers that can be used to water the area. Valves cover a smaller area than the sprinklers. Running your water pipes to bedrock will provide an infinite water source.
- Work stations, from campfires to chem stations, now have a tools area. These are needed to craft certain recipes in the station. The vanilla workbench for example now has slots for a hammer, wire took, and fractal vise. The hammer and wire tool are used for recipes, and the vise speeds up crafting.
- The time/day has been removed from the UI. To add it back either find a wristwatch mod, or there is a Mip Boy you can equip and then check the time with it. There are also working clocks in the world, such as in traders and then randomly in other POIs. You can bring these back to base if you want.

It attempts to remove features which are not time appropriate, and introduce additional features to expand and complement the overall experience. There are over 100 custom POIs with split into those being placed within the Old West type tileset for Towns, and hand placed POIs out of Town and in the Wilderness.
