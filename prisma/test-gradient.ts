 * Original purpose: Test gradient color calculation for game version tags
 * 
 * The gradient calculation logic is now in:
 * - src/lib/tags.ts (recalculateGameVersionColors)
 * - src/app/actions/tag-actions.ts (recalculateGameVersionColors)
 * 
 * To test gradient colors:
 * 1. Use the Admin > Tags page to add/remove gamever tags
 * 2. Colors are automatically recalculated
